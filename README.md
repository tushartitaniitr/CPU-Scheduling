# CPU-Scheduling
i have wrote this code according to the needs of the user . SO first of all it asks whether you want preemptive or NON Preemptive scheduling press "P" for preemptive and any other key for non preemptive . after that
it takes all the input the no of processes(n) then every process you have to give 4 outputs in order of processid>arrivaltime>bursttime>priority. process id should be unique integer (1  to n) priority also(1to n) and prority with a lower number is cosidered to be higher priority .accordingly it tries to get to two optimal solutions one is "scheduling in which there is minimum avg waiting time" . and "Sheduling in which there is Minimum waiting time of a higher priority". and i have shown the stats of avg waiting time in all types of scheduling. i have used FCFS scheduling , NON Preemptive sjf scheduling ,Preemtive sjf scheduling and Round robin scheduling algorithms . and it will found most optimal scheduling algorithm for non premtive and premptive case . and for frontend output i have created html js frontend and backend files with which output can be shown on the frontend.
AS A pre final year student the things that i added myself are first of all according to cpu find best way in both preemptive and non preemptive category and it find optimal solutions in 2 ways and shows all the stats .
